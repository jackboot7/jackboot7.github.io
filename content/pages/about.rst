About me
========

Hi, I'm Luis.

Welcome to my blog/personal page! I hope you will find something interesting on it. Feel free to share or comment.

I'm a long time software engineer turned engineering manager living in Mexico City since 2017.

In my career, I've been involved with most phases of software engineering, from client facing roles, product development/design, hands-on software engineering and management. 
My language of choice is `Python`_

I've worked within a few industries, like financial services (banking, fintech), retail, government institutions, music distribution startups,
etc.

I'm interested in web development, large distributed systems, data visualization, and finances.

Feel free to reach out.
